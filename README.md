# Predicting House Prices using Neural Networks
The goal of this project is to use housing data and neural networks to predict the price of houses in California. This project differs from my STATA project of a similar title, in that this is a predictive, rather than interpretive, model. As noted in *Applied Predictive Modeling*, this means we are primarily concerned with outcome, rather than how the outcome is obtained. I will be using a neural network, and with that, comes a loss of interpretation. At the same time, a neural network offers more maleability and adaptability.

# Dataset
I found the dataset on Kaggle, under the title "California Housing Prices." The dataset originates in the 1990 California census. Although it can't be used to extrapolate information about current housing prices, it is a good excersice in predicting housing prices at the time.

# Analyzing the Dataset
The first step of any data science project is to understand the dataset.
